This is a WooCommerce plugin for making payments using PortOne. It adds a new payment option for your store on the checkout page and opens up a whole lot of options for the user to pay.

The plugin can handle the payments and also your order statuses. It automatically updates the order status for the user if the transaction was successful or failed. It adds necessary notes to the order like transaction reference & if the transaction was unsuccessful, reason and status-code notes are attached to the order.
