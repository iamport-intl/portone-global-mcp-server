The Port Platform feature in PortOne enables merchants (say Master-merchant) to manage multiple sub-merchants under a single master merchant account. Sub-merchants can use the master merchant’s payment channel credentials to process payments, simplifying the management and integration of payment systems for complex merchant networks. This feature is ideal for businesses that operate multiple entities or franchises, allowing them to consolidate payment operations while providing sub-merchants with the tools they need to succeed.
