Payment Pages provide a convenient way to accept payments online, eliminating the need for a website, tedious manual operations, or any coding skills‚Äîmaking it especially useful for small merchants.

## How is the Payment Page different from the Payment link?   [Skip link to How is the Payment Page different from the Payment link?](https://docs.portone.cloud/docs/overview\#how-is-the-payment-page-different-from-the-payment-link)

Payment Links typically have an expiration period, requiring merchants to create new links to continue accepting payments. This is where a Payment Page becomes invaluable. A Payment Page can be thought of as a cluster of reusable payment links. Each time a customer clicks the ‚ÄòPay‚Äô button on a Payment Page, a new payment link is automatically generated.

Just like payment links, Payment Pages allow merchants to accept online payments from customers through a simple and straightforward process.
