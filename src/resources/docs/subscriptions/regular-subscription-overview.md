## Introduction   [Skip link to Introduction](https://docs.portone.cloud/docs/regular-subscription-overview\#introduction)

A **Regular Subscription** is a recurring payment model where customers are charged automatically at predefined intervals for products or services. This payment method is ideal for subscriptions with predictable billing structures, such as memberships, streaming services, or recurring deliveries.

The **Regular Subscription** process involves creating plans, defining the billing cycle, and managing recurring payments securely through PortOne's system.
