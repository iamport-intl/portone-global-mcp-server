## Introduction   [Skip link to Introduction](https://docs.portone.cloud/docs/overview-subscription\#introduction)

Subscriptions are a business model where customers make recurring payments to access a product or service over a defined period, such as weekly, monthly, or annually. This model is widely used across various industries, from streaming services and software to fitness memberships, meal kits, and publications. Subscriptions offer customers convenience by automating renewals and providing ongoing access to products or services without needing to purchase them repeatedly. For businesses, subscriptions create predictable revenue streams, enhance customer retention, and allow for more precise forecasting.

There are several types of subscription models tailored to different customer needs. For instance, Regular Subscriptions involve scheduled, predictable payments for ongoing access, such as with magazine subscriptions or streaming services. On Demand Subscriptions, on the other hand, are flexible and allow businesses to charge customers based on usage or activity, common with services like ride-sharing or online orders. Subscription models are also highly customizable, often allowing businesses to offer various plans and pricing tiers, enabling customers to choose a subscription that best fits their needs and budget. This adaptability makes subscriptions a powerful tool for delivering value and building lasting customer relationships.

Subscription links are a simple and convenient way for businesses to initiate subscriptions without needing a complex checkout system. Here’s a summary of what they are:

**Definition**: Subscription links are unique URLs generated by a payment provider that direct customers to a secure subscription page.

**Functionality**: Customers can use the link to select their payment method and complete the subscriptions directly from their device, such as a smartphone, tablet, or computer.

**Use Cases**: They are often used by businesses that do not have an integrated online subscription system, such as small merchants, freelancers, service providers, and those who sell via social media or messaging platforms.

**Advantages**:

- No Website Needed: Businesses can collect subscription payments without needing a full e-commerce site.
- Ease of Use: Links can be shared through various channels like email, SMS, or social media.
- Customizable: Many services allow customization of the subscription page to reflect the business’s branding.

In essence, Subscription links streamline the subscription payment collection process, making it easier for both businesses and their customers.

### Regular Subscription   [Skip link to Regular Subscription](https://docs.portone.cloud/docs/overview-subscription\#regular-subscription)

A Regular Subscription is a type of automated payment setup where a customer authorizes a merchant to charge their credit or debit card (or other payment method) at regular intervals. These payments are pre-arranged for a specified frequency—such as weekly, monthly, or annually—and involve a fixed amount. Regular Subscriptions are ideal for services with a predictable billing structure, like subscription services (e.g., streaming platforms), memberships (e.g., gyms), or regular bills (e.g., utilities or insurance premiums).

In a Regular Subscription setup, the customer consents to ongoing charges by entering into an agreement at the beginning of the service, specifying both the frequency and the amount to be charged. This allows the merchant to bill without further input from the customer each time. This system benefits both the customer, who enjoys hands-off billing, and the business, which gains a steady cash flow.

### OnDemand Subscription   [Skip link to OnDemand Subscription](https://docs.portone.cloud/docs/overview-subscription\#ondemand-subscription)

An On Demand Subscription is a flexible payment setup where a customer authorizes a merchant to securely keep their card details on file for future transactions that the merchant can initiate as needed. Unlike regular subscriptions, On Demand Subscriptions don’t follow a set schedule or fixed amount. Instead, they allow the merchant to charge the card based on the customer’s activity or demand, making it ideal for services with varying or unpredictable usage, such as ride-sharing, online orders, or hotel incidental fees.

With On Demand Subscriptions, the customer gives a one-time authorization for the card to remain on file, enabling the business to initiate charges whenever applicable without additional customer input each time. This setup prioritizes flexibility and convenience, creating a smooth, frictionless experience for the customer by reducing the need for repeated authorization. It’s a popular choice for businesses that offer variable-rate services, giving them a compliant way to process payments on demand.
