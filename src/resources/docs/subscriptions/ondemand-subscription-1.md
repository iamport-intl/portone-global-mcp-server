## Introduction   [Skip link to Introduction](https://docs.portone.cloud/docs/ondemand-subscription-1\#introduction)

An **On-Demand Subscription** is a flexible payment model where customers authorize merchants to store their payment details securely for future transactions. Unlike Regular Subscriptions, On-Demand Subscriptions do not follow a fixed schedule or amount. Instead, merchants can initiate charges as needed, based on customer usage or activity.

This model is ideal for businesses offering services with variable usage patterns, such as ride-sharing, cloud storage, or pay-as-you-go utilities. It provides customers with the flexibility to pay only for what they use, while businesses benefit from a seamless and secure payment collection process.
