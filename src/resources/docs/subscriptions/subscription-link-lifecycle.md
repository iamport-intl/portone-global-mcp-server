## 1\. Created State   [Skip link to 1. Created State](https://docs.portone.cloud/docs/subscription-link-lifecycle\#1-created-state)

**Description**: This is the initial state when a subscription link is generated by the merchant. The link is ready to be shared with the customer, allowing them to initiate the subscription payment.

**Transition**: After the link is created, it can move to any of the following states depending on the customer's interaction and other external conditions.

## 2\. Active State   [Skip link to 2. Active State](https://docs.portone.cloud/docs/subscription-link-lifecycle\#2-active-state)

**Description**: The "Active" state occurs when the customer has made the initial payment and we have the customer's payment details with us, We can deduct the specified amount at the required interval as per the configuration mentioned while creating the subscription link.

**Transition**: The link transitions from "Active" to "Completed" upon successful deduction of all the amount according to the interval selected while creating the subscription link.

## 3\. Completed State   [Skip link to 3. Completed State](https://docs.portone.cloud/docs/subscription-link-lifecycle\#3-completed-state)

**Description**: The "Completed" state indicates that the customer has successfully paid all the required amounts at the required interval as per the configuration mentioned while creating the subscription link.

**Transition**: Once in the "Completed" state, no further transitions are possible, as the subscription is finalized.

## 4\. Expired State   [Skip link to 4. Expired State](https://docs.portone.cloud/docs/subscription-link-lifecycle\#4-expired-state)

**Description**: If the subscription link is not used within a certain period it will expire. An expired link cannot be used again, and the customer will need a new link to attempt the subscription.

**Transition**: The "Expired" state is a terminal state; once expired, the link cannot be reactivated or transitioned to any other state.

## 5\. Cancelled State   [Skip link to 5. Cancelled State](https://docs.portone.cloud/docs/subscription-link-lifecycle\#5-cancelled-state)

**Description**:: The subscription link may be cancelled by the merchant or the system due to various reasons (e.g., the merchant decides not to proceed, customer request, or policy constraints).

**Transition**: Once a link is cancelled, it cannot proceed to any other state and is considered closed. No further action can be taken using this link.
