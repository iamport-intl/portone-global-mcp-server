## Introduction   [Skip link to Introduction](https://docs.portone.cloud/docs/on-demand-subscription-overview\#introduction)

An **On-Demand Subscription** is a flexible payment model where customers authorize merchants to store their payment details securely for future transactions. Unlike Regular Subscriptions, On-Demand Subscriptions do not follow a fixed schedule or amount. Instead, merchants can initiate charges as needed, based on customer usage or activity.

This model is ideal for businesses offering services with variable usage patterns, such as ride-sharing, cloud storage, or pay-as-you-go utilities. It provides customers with the flexibility to pay only for what they use, while businesses benefit from a seamless and secure payment collection process.

## How On-Demand Subscriptions Work   [Skip link to How On-Demand Subscriptions Work](https://docs.portone.cloud/docs/on-demand-subscription-overview\#how-on-demand-subscriptions-work)

1. **Customer Authorization**

- Customers provide a one-time authorization for merchants to securely store their payment details.
- The authorization allows merchants to initiate future charges without requiring customer approval each time.

2. **Usage-Based Billing**

- Merchants charge customers based on their activity, usage, or demand.
- There is no predefined billing frequency or fixed amount.
