# PortOne Global Developer Documentation

> PortOne is a service that provides APIs and SDKs for online payments, identity verification, partner settlement automation, and financial/accounting tasks.

1. Each document file in the PortOne Developer Documentation has a pathname, title, and description, which can be used to infer the document's content.

   - `getting-started/`: Documents related to Setting up PortOne account, etc
   - `payment-integration/`: Documents related to payment integration steps, payment service, checkout service, web-sdk, mobile integration
   - `payment-integration/payment-channels`: Documents related to testing data and other details of the supported Payment Service providers or Payment Channels

3. To check API and SDK schemas, you can accurately review them in YAML, JSON, or GraphQL SDL formats from the schema files of the relevant version.

4. When providing document reference URLs to users, use the Developer Center website URL rather than Markdown file links.
   - For URLs missing the hostname, prepend `https://docs.portone.cloud` when sharing.

5. Most images and file download links are missing in Markdown documents. These need to be checked on the PortOne developer docs website
