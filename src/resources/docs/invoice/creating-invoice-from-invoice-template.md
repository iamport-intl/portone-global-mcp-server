An Invoice Template in PortOne is a pre-defined data structure designed to streamline the invoice creation process. It allows you to set up reusable templates with prefilled details such as product/service descriptions, tax rates, payment terms, and default settings. These templates act as a foundation for generating multiple invoices quickly and consistently.

By using Invoice Templates, businesses can save time, minimize errors, and ensure uniformity across all invoices.
