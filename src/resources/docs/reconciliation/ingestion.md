The key steps in this process include:

1. **Select Data Source and Upload File:**


Users begin by selecting the relevant data source from the list of configured sources.


Files can be uploaded manually or ingested through alternative channels like:

   - **SFTP**: Securely transfer files via SFTP for automated ingestion.
   - **Email Auto-forwarding**: Set up email forwarding to automatically process files received via email.
   - **API Integration**: If APIs are available, data can be fetched directly from the source, allowing for real-time ingestion.
2. **Create Ingestion Record:**


Once the file is uploaded, the system generates an ingestion record that logs key metadata such as the file name, source, upload time, and user details.
3. **Display List of Ingestions:**


The ingestion screen displays a list of all ingested files with the following information:

   - **Ingestion Status**: Indicates the current processing stage:

     - **Initiated**: The system has initiated data processing.
     - **Validation Failed**: Issues identified during the validation step, requiring user intervention.
     - **Ingestion Failed**: Issues occurred during ingestion, PortOne team will be notified and the issue will be resolved on priority.
     - **Success**: Data is successfully ingested and ready for reconciliation.
   - **Metadata**: Shows relevant details like file size, upload date, data source, and number of records.
4. **Validate and Ingest Data:**


The system performs data validation checks to ensure the uploaded files meet the required format and standards.


If validation is successful, the data is ingested into the reconciliation system. Errors during validation are highlighted for user review and correction.
5. **Update Ingestion Status:**


The status of each ingestion record is updated in real time to reflect the current state.
